1.  **Rebrand:** Use the Claritone brand and logo.
2.  **Simplify:** Create a simple, single-page website focused exclusively on presenting video support tutorials for hearing aids.
3.  **Layout:** Display videos in a responsive grid layout (3 per row on desktop).
4.  **Content:** Populate the site with a list of 10 specific YouTube videos provided by the user.
5.  **Booking CTA:**
    *   Add a sticky top banner with the text Book your free onboarding call now... and a Book button.
    *   Add an onboarding popup that appears on page load to encourage booking a call.
6.  **Integration:** Link the Book buttons in the banner and popup to a Calendly URL provided by the user ().
7.  **Contact Info:** Update the header and footer with a specific support phone number () and email ().
8.  **Deployment:** Assist the user in deploying the final website to their cPanel hosting at the subdomain .

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
A complete, frontend-only React application named Claritone Support Center. The application is a static site featuring a sticky banner, an onboarding popup with Calendly integration, a header with correct contact info, a responsive grid displaying 10 YouTube support videos, and a footer. The production-ready build files have been successfully pushed to the user's private GitHub repository.

**Last working item**:
*   **Last item agent was working on:** The agent was troubleshooting why the user's live website () was not showing the recently updated contact information (phone and email). The agent determined that the code in the development environment and on GitHub is correct, but the user has not yet deployed these latest changes to their cPanel server.
*   **Status:** USER VERIFICATION PENDING
*   **Agent Testing Done:** Y
*   **Which testing method agent to use?** Manual testing by user. The user needs to download the latest code from GitHub, upload it to their cPanel, and then verify the changes on their live website.
*   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
*   **Issue 1:** The live website at  is showing outdated contact information because the latest code has not been deployed. (Priority: P0)

    *   **Attempted fixes:** The agent has already fixed the code, rebuilt the application, and pushed the correct production files to the user's GitHub repository. The agent also confirmed via screenshot that the development environment is correct, while the live site is not.
    *   **Next debug checklist:** This is a deployment issue, not a code bug. The user must perform the following actions:
        1.  Go to their GitHub repository: .
        2.  Click the green Code button and select Download ZIP.
        3.  Log into their cPanel account.
        4.  Navigate to the File Manager for the  document root.
        5.  **Delete all existing files and folders** from the previous deployment.
        6.  **Upload and extract** the contents of the newly downloaded ZIP file.
        7.  Clear browser cache and perform a hard refresh ( or ) when visiting the live URL.
    *   **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** To ensure customers visiting the live support page see the correct phone number and email address.
    *   **Status:** USER VERIFICATION PENDING
    *   **Is recurring issue?** N
    *   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend (the live URL).
    *   **Blocked on other issue:** None.

**In progress Task List**:
*   **Task 1:** Complete the deployment of the final website to the user's  domain.

    *   **Where to resume:** The agent has provided all necessary files on GitHub and given clear instructions. The agent should now wait for the user to confirm they have attempted to upload the new files and assist if they face any issues during the cPanel process.
    *   **What will be achieved with this?** The user's live website will be fully updated with all requested features and correct information.
    *   **Status:** IN PROGRESS (blocked on user action)
    *   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Frontend (the live URL).
    *   **Blocked on something:** The user needs to perform the file upload to their cPanel server.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
*   None. The project is feature-complete pending final deployment.

**Completed work in this session**
*   **Application Build:** Created a full-featured, single-page React application for video support.
*   **Branding & UI:** Implemented Claritone branding, custom logo, and a responsive video grid layout.
*   **Content Integration:** Populated the site with 10 specific YouTube videos from the user's playlist.
*   **Calendly Integration:** Added a sticky banner and a popup modal, both linked to the user's Calendly for booking calls.
*   **Contact Info Update:** Corrected and implemented the support phone number and email in the header and footer.
*   **Deployment Preparation:**
    *   Created a production build of the application.
    *   Configured an  file for proper routing on Apache servers (cPanel).
    *   Pushed all production-ready files to the user's private GitHub repository for easy access and deployment.
*   **Documentation:** Created extensive markdown guides for deployment, testing, and setup.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
*   None. All issues raised during the session (e.g., incorrect video URLs, thumbnail updates, removing Emergent badge) were successfully resolved.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
*   N/A

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
*   **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS
*   **Integrations:** Calendly (embedded widget), YouTube (thumbnails and player)
*   **Deployment:** Static site deployment to a cPanel/Apache environment.
*   **Version Control:** Git, with final code pushed to the user's GitHub repository.

**key DB schema**
*   N/A (The application is frontend-only and does not use a database).

**changes in tech stack**
*   The project uses only the frontend portion of the initial full-stack template. The FastAPI backend and MongoDB are not utilized.

**All files**
*   **Key Application Files:**
    *   : Assembles all UI components to form the page.
    *   : Displays the grid of YouTube videos.
    *   : The top banner with the Calendly link.
    *   : The popup modal with the Calendly link.
    *   : Hardcoded list of video details (ID, title, description).
    *   : Contains the script links for Calendly's widget.
*   **Key Deployment Files (on GitHub):**
    *   : The entry point for the static site.
    *   : Folder containing compiled JS and CSS.
    *   : Apache config to handle client-side routing.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
*   The primary task is to guide the user to complete the deployment. The code itself is finished and correct.
*   The source of truth for the deployment files is the user's GitHub repository: .
*   The current issue is that the user is looking at their live website () and seeing old content. You must guide them to upload the new files from GitHub to their cPanel server to resolve this.
*   Do not try to fix the issue by changing code in the Emergent environment. The deployment workflow is **Develop (Emergent) -> Push to GitHub -> User Downloads -> User Uploads to cPanel**. The issue is in the final step.

**documents created in this job**
*   
*   
*   
*   
*   And several other setup/quick-start guides.
